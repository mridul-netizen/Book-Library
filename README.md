# GraphQL
This is a GraphQL project.GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

## To run the project open the client and server folder in two seperate terminals.Latest version of node should be installed in order to run the project
run `npm install` in both directories "client" as well as "server" to install all the packages that are needed
and `npm run start` in your client directory
Now run `nodemon app` in your server directory
This will open a react app at port localhost:3000
and  server is for connecting to the database.
for opening the graphiql tool visit to http://localhost:4000/graphql
database of books have been created at Mlab
